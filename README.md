Hello, my name is Nick Caporusso and I am currently a Senior at Northern Arizona University studying Computer Science graduating in May 2022.

I am extremely interested in learning AI and would like to persue that field as my career path, but 
for now I want to learn as much as I possibly can about coding and the proper ways in how to code effectively.

Iâ€™m currently learning how to properly build an Operating System, Algorithms, AI, proper steps on how to build a software, and Computer Networks.

For any questions you might have for me, you can email/text me at any point of the day and I will get back to you as soon as I can!

Email: Nick.caporusso29@gmail.com

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Hope you enjoy my work and have a great day.
- Nick Caporusso
